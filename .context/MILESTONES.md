# MILESTONES.md — SKVN Marine

> Source of truth cho milestone hiện tại và checklist chuyển mốc.
> File này phải được đọc khi bắt đầu task.
> Chỉ human mới có quyền xác nhận chuyển milestone/version.

---

## Current Milestone

Current: **V1 / 1.3.10 — Fullscreen Step Slider**
Status: **PENDING**
Started: **not yet**

AGENTS.md current milestone phải match file này.

---

## Transition Rule

Chỉ chuyển milestone khi:

- Tất cả acceptance checklist của milestone hiện tại đã DONE.
- Runtime smoke test liên quan đã chạy.
- Human explicitly approve chuyển milestone.

Khi chuyển milestone:

1. Update `AGENTS.md` current milestone.
2. Update `.context/MILESTONES.md` current milestone.
3. If this is a release/deploy boundary, verify WordPress theme/plugin release metadata with `node tools/bump-project-version.mjs <version>` and follow `docs/workflows/versioning-release-workflow.md`.
4. If the milestone added or changed runtime PHP `require`/`include` paths, run the runtime file audit in `docs/workflows/deploy-artifact-workflow.md` before zip upload.
5. Move completed milestone checklist/notes sang `.context/MILESTONES_HISTORY.md`.
6. Move `RESOLVED_ACTIVE` tensions của milestone cũ từ `.context/TENSIONS_ACTIVE.md` sang `.context/TENSIONS_HISTORY.md`, đổi `Status: ARCHIVED`.
7. Giữ lại OPEN tensions còn liên quan trong `.context/TENSIONS_OPEN.md`.
8. Không tự archive hoặc tự chuyển milestone nếu human chưa approve.

## Version Naming Rule

- Version dùng SemVer: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- `MAJOR` tăng khi đổi phase lớn hoặc đổi kiến trúc/phạm vi sản phẩm lớn, ví dụ `1.x.x` → `2.0.0`.
- `MINOR` tăng khi thêm feature/scope mới nhưng vẫn cùng major, ví dụ `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`.
- `PATCH` tăng khi fix, hardening, hoặc integration nhỏ trong cùng minor, ví dụ `0.5.0` → `0.5.1`.
- Version launch-ready của một major là `MAJOR.0.0`, ví dụ `1.0.0` là V1 launch-ready, `2.0.0` là V2 launch-ready.
- Không dùng nhãn kiểu `1.0.0 Prep` cho feature mới. Nếu là prep trước launch, nó phải nằm trong milestone trước launch hoặc ghi `Future Candidate`.
- Nếu chưa chắc version của future work, ghi `Future Candidate` thay vì tự gán version.
- Planning filename phải khớp target version chính, ví dụ `001_VERSION_1_1_0_<TOPIC>_PLANNING.md` hoặc `002_VERSION_2_0_0_<TOPIC>_PLANNING.md`.
- Không đổi current milestone/version nếu chưa có human approve rõ ràng.
- `.context/MILESTONES.md` is the planning/scope source of truth. It does not automatically update WordPress theme/plugin `Version:` headers.
- When human explicitly starts a milestone, the agent may run `node tools/bump-project-version.mjs <version>` and rebuild plugin assets so the working WordPress metadata advertises the current milestone version. This is a milestone development build, not release approval.
- Before packaging or deploying a milestone release, verify again with `node tools/bump-project-version.mjs <version>` and rebuild plugin assets.

## Current V1.x Checkpoint

### 1.1.2 — Product Quote Flow & Map Block Testing

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Resolve deferred quote data-flow testing after the CF7 interface has already passed onsite visual review.
- Test quote submission from product/product-card/page-block flows, not only the standalone Request Quote page.
- Confirm map block/display issue because the current map surface is not viewable.
- Treat this as testing and source hardening around blocks/pages, not a custom CF7 form handler.

Carry-in from 0.10.0:

- CF7/Request Quote interface visual check: **PASS by human feedback on 2026-06-05**.
- Remaining quote debt is data flow only: submit, store, hidden/context fields, product-origin query params, and success/thank-you behavior.

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Human runs `docs/testing/onsite-quote-flow-0.7.0.md` data-flow section from a product/product-card/page-block origin
- [ ] Human runs `docs/testing/onsite-quote-flow-0.7.1.md` runtime handoff data-flow section
- [ ] Human runs `docs/testing/onsite-map-block-1.1.2.md` on the onsite map page/surface
- [ ] Request Quote form submission succeeds from product-origin URL/query params
- [ ] CFDB7 stores at least one test submission
- [ ] CFDB7 row confirms visible fields are stored
- [ ] CFDB7 row confirms hidden/context fields are stored: `product_id`, `product_sku`, `product_name`, `product_url`, `source_url`, and UTM fields
- [ ] Thank-you/success UX confirmed
- [ ] Product CTA/query params confirmed from onsite product/product-card/page-block flow
- [ ] Console/log issues recorded or confirmed clean for quote flow
- [ ] Map block/display surface is visible onsite
- [ ] If current map cannot be viewed, mismatch is documented with screenshot, target URL, block markup/source, and console notes
- [ ] No custom PHP form handler is introduced
- [ ] No n8n webhook is exposed or required
- [ ] Human approves closing 1.1.2 testing

### 1.3.1 — Slider Navigation & Pagination Controls UX

Status: **DONE**
Started: **2026-06-11**
Completed: **2026-06-12**
Approved by human: **2026-06-12**

Purpose:

- Replace the dots-specific editor concept with a complete pagination contract.
- Add independent arrow and pagination visibility, style, and position controls.
- Add Swiper-owned timed fraction and timed segments without a second autoplay
  or timer controller.
- Keep one Slider-level governed duration and no per-Slide duration.
- Build on the corrected V1 / 1.3.0 media, geometry, pagination, and memory
  foundation.

Decision:

- `docs/decisions/slider-navigation-and-pagination-controls.md`

Dependencies:

- V1 / 1.3.0 dynamic rendering and repair foundation completed with human
  onsite approval on 2026-06-11.
- Existing `dots` and arbitrary delay values need explicit Gutenberg
  compatibility behavior.

Acceptance draft:

- [x] `dots` migrates to the approved pagination contract without invalidating existing content
- [x] Arrow visibility, three styles, and four positions follow the decision contract
- [x] Pill is disabled when Side center is selected
- [x] Pagination visibility, four styles, and three positions follow the decision contract
- [x] Matching bottom positions cluster as `arrows | pagination`
- [x] Different arrow and pagination positions remain independent
- [x] Zero/one real Slide hides both control families and disables autoplay
- [x] Timed pagination follows Swiper autoplay without a second timer/controller
- [x] Current/total numbering uses real Slides and excludes loop clones
- [x] Slider duration uses governed `5/7/9/12s` choices with a documented legacy-value policy
- [x] Hover, focus, document visibility, and interaction pause reasons compose correctly
- [x] Mobile and reduced-motion fallbacks work
- [x] Editor preview remains static and does not run autoplay/timer progress
- [x] Human approves 1.3.1 controls UX implementation



### 1.3.3 — Dynamic Product And Post Collections

Status: **DONE**
Started: **2026-06-13**
Completed: **2026-06-16**
Approved by human: **2026-06-16**
Note: Implementation shipped. Remaining onsite QA for product grid and post collection deferred to 1.3.9.

Purpose:

- Add governed dynamic collection blocks for product and post surfaces:
  Product Grid, Product Carousel, Post Grid, and Post Carousel.
- Use custom SKVN dynamic blocks while querying/rendering through native
  WordPress and WooCommerce APIs under the hood.
- Keep editor UX simple with four inserter choices, backed by two logic blocks:
  `skvn-marine/product-collection` and `skvn-marine/post-collection`.
- Preserve B2B funnel context through product card actions and Request Quote
  URLs.
- Ship plugin-owned baseline CSS/runtime so the blocks remain portable if the
  SKVN theme changes.

Decision:

- `docs/decisions/skvn-dynamic-collections-1.3.3.md`

Planning:

- `.context/planning/archives/024_VERSION_1_3_3_DYNAMIC_COLLECTIONS_PLANNING.md`

Testing:

- `docs/testing/onsite-dynamic-collections-1.3.3.md`

Architecture:

- Product collections own WooCommerce product query, product card markup,
  quote/context actions, and WooCommerce inactive fallback.
- Post collections own WordPress post query and post card markup.
- Grid and Carousel are layout modes, not separate query owners.
- Editor-facing inserter choices are:
  `SKVN Product Grid`, `SKVN Product Carousel`, `SKVN Post Grid`,
  and `SKVN Post Carousel`.
- Saved content stores query/layout/action attributes only. It does not store
  snapshots of product or post card HTML.
- Carousel layouts reuse only the relevant Slider/Swiper foundation: adapter,
  pause policy, document visibility behavior, and reduced-motion guard.
- Grid layouts do not load carousel runtime.
- Product/Post cards must not be forced into `skvn-marine/slide` InnerBlocks.

Constraints:

- Do not use direct custom SQL.
- Do not depend on WooCommerce experimental Product Collection extension APIs
  as the SKVN source of truth in V1.
- Do not save product/post snapshots into page content.
- Do not implement Product Taxonomy Collections admin in this milestone.
- Do not implement product attribute query, faceted filters, AJAX load more,
  grouped taxonomy navigation, archive builder, or universal CPT collection in
  this milestone.
- Do not add custom object/transient caching unless onsite evidence proves it
  is required.
- Product collections must not fatal when WooCommerce is inactive.
- Carousel autoplay is off by default, disabled for reduced motion, and must not
  run in the editor.
- If autoplay is enabled, render a visible Pause/Play control.

Implementation order:

1. Contract and shared constants/types.
2. Post Collection Grid.
3. Product Collection Grid.
4. Shared carousel runtime and Product/Post Carousel variations.
5. Performance, dependency, fallback, and accessibility hardening.
6. Human onsite QA and source fix pass.

Acceptance draft:

- [x] `docs/decisions/skvn-dynamic-collections-1.3.3.md` is reviewed before source implementation
- [x] `skvn-marine/product-collection` and `skvn-marine/post-collection` are registered as dynamic blocks
- [x] Four inserter choices exist: Product Grid, Product Carousel, Post Grid, Post Carousel
- [x] Saved markup stores attributes only and does not snapshot product/post cards
- [ ] Product collections query through WooCommerce/native APIs without direct custom SQL
- [x] Post collections query through WordPress native APIs
- [ ] Query controls support category/tag multi-select, `AND`/`OR`, item limit, and approved order modes
- [ ] `Shuffle balanced pool` avoids SQL random ordering and uses the documented pool strategy
- [x] Grid respects max 5 columns and max 3 rows
- [x] Carousel respects max 10 items
- [x] Responsive presets `1-1-1`, `2-1-1`, `3-2-1`, `4-2-1`, and `5-3-1` work
- [ ] Product cards support governed field visibility and quote/view/custom action modes
- [ ] Request Quote action preserves product context in the generated URL
- [ ] Post cards support governed field visibility and read/custom action modes
- [ ] Badge behavior supports display-only and archive-link modes
- [ ] Product image fallback uses product image, WooCommerce placeholder, then SKVN fallback
- [ ] Post image fallback uses featured image, then SKVN fallback
- [ ] Carousel reuses shared pause/reduced-motion policy without making grid load carousel runtime
- [ ] Autoplay off/default, pause, document visibility, focus, and reduced-motion behavior pass
- [x] WooCommerce inactive state does not fatal product collection blocks
- [x] Plugin baseline CSS keeps blocks readable without relying on theme patterns
- [ ] Theme pattern follow-up is deferred until plugin implementation and onsite QA pass
- [ ] Plugin build, PHP syntax checks, deploy artifact audit if runtime PHP paths change, and onsite QA pass
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion

Deferred to 2.x.x or later:

- `Products -> Taxonomy Collections`
- Product Taxonomy Collections admin

### 1.3.9 — Custom Icon Upload

Status: **PARKING / Future Candidate**

Purpose:

- Upload custom icon asset for SKVN Marine branding (block inserter, admin menu).
- Defer until icon design finalized.

### 1.3.4 — Core Control Foundation & Core Button Hover

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Add `SKVN Marine -> Core Control` as the shared settings and registry surface
  for optional WordPress core-block and editor enhancements.
- Establish a migration-ready Core Control architecture inside the current
  `skvn-marine-blocks` plugin.
- Prove the architecture with the first opt-in enhancement:
  `Core Button Hover Colors`.
- Move the existing editor-only Block Copy/Paste utility under Core Control and
  govern it with the same registry and option.

Decision:

- `docs/decisions/core-control-core-button-hover.md`

Planning:

- `.context/planning/archives/023_VERSION_1_3_4_CORE_CONTROL_PLANNING.md`

Dependencies:

- V1 / 1.3.1 remains focused on Slider controls and contract completion.
- Human must approve starting V1 / 1.3.4 before implementation or project
  version metadata changes.

Scope:

- Add a module-shaped PHP foundation under `modules/core-control/`.
- Add editor extension code under `src/core-controls/`.
- Store feature toggles in the namespaced `skvn_core_controls` option.
- Register one reusable feature registry so later core enhancements do not
  duplicate menu, Settings API, sanitization, or asset-loading logic.
- Add `Core Button Hover Colors`, disabled by default.
- Add `Block Copy/Paste`, disabled by default.
- Extend all `core/button` blocks with namespaced hover text/background color
  controls in a separate stable Inspector panel.
- Apply configured colors to `:hover` and `:focus-visible`, with scoped CSS and
  reduced-motion handling.
- Preserve compatibility attributes and saved values when the feature is
  disabled.
- Block Copy/Paste must not override native clipboard handlers, alter saved
  markup, add frontend assets, or depend on Gutenberg private DOM/UI.

Constraints:

- Do not modify WordPress core, Gutenberg private panel UI, or GeneratePress.
- Do not create or rename a plugin.
- Do not use raw unnamespaced attributes, classes, options, or CSS variables.
- Do not use `!important` or require frontend JavaScript.
- The feature toggle controls UI and styling, not parsing compatibility.
- Do not add Core Control enhancements beyond Button Hover and Block Copy/Paste
  in this milestone.

### 1.3.10 — Fullscreen Step Slider

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Add a dedicated fullscreen process/timeline Slider block for urgent landing
  page storytelling needs.
- Build it on top of the V1 / 1.3.0 dynamic Slider rendering foundation instead
  of creating a second Slider engine.
- Provide bottom tab navigation with per-step progress, media/content layers,
  and motion presets suitable for sequential process narratives.
- Keep Gutenberg-native editing with InnerBlocks and child step blocks; do not
  switch to a `slides` array or custom slide repeater.
- Inherit parallax foundation from V1 / 1.3.8 and adapt as needed.

Planning:

- `.context/planning/018_VERSION_1_3_10_FULLSCREEN_STEP_SLIDER_PLANNING.md`

Decision:

- `docs/decisions/fullscreen-step-slider-1.3.10.md`

### 1.3.7 — Collection Block UI & Card Styles

Status: **DONE**
Started: **2026-06-23**
Completed: **2026-07-01**
Approved by human: **2026-07-01**

Human confirmed (Option A + added scope 2026-06-22): Dedicated 1.3.7 slot for collection UI/card styles polish + "hover button" work (fix stuck case of buttons inside Slider not receiving hover like Gutenberg `a:hover { color: var(--contrast); }` mechanism, plus polish hovers on new collection CTAs). See `docs/testing/onsite-button-hover-1.3.7.md` for DevTools verification steps. Planning source 028 finalized; button hover compatibility pulled from 1.3.8 plans per user request. Human moved current milestone to 1.3.7 on 2026-06-23.

Human routing (2026-06-23): Implementation + build gate thuộc **1.3.7**; onsite/human/DevTools QA thuộc **1.3.11**.

Purpose:

- Nâng cấp giao diện và UX của `skvn-marine/product-collection` và `skvn-marine/post-collection`.
- Fix 2 bugs đã xác nhận từ code review (2026-06-17).
- Thêm các block attribute mới để kiểm soát heading, spacing, archive CTA.
- Triển khai card style variants dựa trên design artifact `.local/Seafood Export Carousels Tailwind.html`.
- **Không bao gồm** các feature yêu cầu data model chưa tồn tại (MOQ, Lead Time, certifications) — đó là scope 1.5.0.
- Resolve "hover button" for action elements: ensure new collection CTAs (quote, catalog, read-more...) have proper hovers per 028 spec + reduced-motion; make buttons/links inside Slider respect base Gutenberg hover (`a:hover, a:focus, a:active { color: var(--contrast); }`) or Core Button Hover feature when configured (without being overridden by hero preset hard-codes). DevTools tests per contract (specificity, class/vars, computed styles on :hover).

Planning:

- `.context/planning/028_VER_1_3_7_COLLECTION_UI_CARD_STYLES_PLANNING.md`
- `.context/planning/026_VER_1_3_6_BLOCK_EDITOR_UX_AND_SLIDER_PARALLAX_PLANNING.md` (Trục A — carry-in)
- `.context/planning/archives/031_VER_1_3_6_SLIDER_BOTTOM_CENTER_FLANK_CONTROLS_PLANNING.md` (Trục D — carry-in, source shipped)

Onsite QA: deferred to **1.3.11** (`onsite-button-hover-1.3.7.md`, `onsite-dynamic-collections-1.3.3.md`, `onsite-slider-flank-controls-1.3.6.md`).

Design artifact:

- `.local/Seafood Carousels.html` — UI reference (bundled HTML, mở bằng browser)

Bugs cần fix (đã xác nhận):

- `imageRatio` attribute không tạo class `skvn-collection--ratio-*` → ratio setting vô nghĩa
- Carousel arrows (`left: -1.25rem` / `right: -1.25rem`) bị clip bởi `overflow: hidden` của Swiper container

Phase 1 scope (data có sẵn — làm được ngay):

- Spacing: `margin-top` / `margin-bottom` cho `.skvn-collection` section, khoảng cách heading → grid/carousel
- Heading controls: toggle `showHeading` (boolean), `eyebrow` text attribute (vd: "EXPORT CATALOG", "INSIGHTS")
- Intro text: attribute `intro` đã có, cần đảm bảo render và style đúng
- Archive CTA: `archiveUrl` + `archiveLabel` attribute cho section footer ("Xem toàn bộ danh mục →", "Đọc tất cả bài viết →")
- Catalog CTA: `showCatalogCta: boolean` + `catalogCtaUrl: string` + `catalogCtaLabel: string` (default: "Tải catalog") — toggle on/off, URL do user tự điền (PDF trực tiếp hoặc lead gen page). Áp dụng cho cả `product-collection` và `post-collection`.
- Card styles: ít nhất 1 style variant từ design artifact (product card + post card)
- Category badge overlay trên ảnh (thay vì bên dưới title như hiện tại)
- 4-column preset: thêm option `4-2-1` vào SelectControl editor và CSS
- Hover polish for new CTAs (catalog-cta, cta, read-more, archive, pdf per 028 CSS) + reduced-motion guard.
- Slider button hover compatibility (buttons inside slides use custom hover from Core feature or base --contrast when expected; hero hard-codes use var fallback).

Các feature CHƯA planning xong (cần brainstorm tiếp):

- Card style system: bao nhiêu style variant? switch bằng attribute hay CSS class? theme override hay plugin-owned?
- Prefetch strategy: hover-prefetch cho product card links hay không? Ảnh hưởng performance thế nào?
- Image ratio per collection type: product default 1:1, post default 16:9 — hardcode theo preset hay user-selectable?
- `badgeBehavior: 'overlay'` — overlay badge trên ảnh có cần thêm enum value mới không?

Constraints:

- Không implement MOQ, Lead Time, certifications, spec sheet PDF — scope 1.5.0.
- Card styles phải work với dữ liệu WooCommerce/WP có sẵn, không cần custom meta.
- Plugin-owned CSS; không phụ thuộc vào theme class.
- Hover work must follow gutenberg-block-extension-css-contract.md (specificity check in DevTools first, editor.BlockListBlock for preview, scoped class+vars, behavior test not source grep, reduced-motion for all hovers). Slider case limited to making preset hovers respect feature vars (no change to core-control itself).

Acceptance draft:

### 1.4.0 — SKVN Theme Init Setup UI

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Discuss and design an wp-admin setup screen for reusable SKVN setup tasks.
- Candidate setup card: Request A Quote Workflow.
- The UI should let an admin load a reviewed setup template from wp-admin instead of requiring WP-CLI for every setup pass.

Wireframe note:

```text
Admin sidebar
└── SKVN Theme init setup
    ├── [Request A Quote Workflow]
    ├── [Future setup card]
    ├── [Future setup card]
    └── [Nạp setup]
```

Constraints:

- Do not implement in 0.7.0 or 0.10.0.
- Must be discussed carefully before implementation.
- Must not add a dependency/plugin unless human explicitly changes dependency policy.
- Must not custom-code CF7 form handling; setup UI may only create/update approved WP content/config.
- Must require wp-admin capability checks and nonce protection when implemented.

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Human approves exact setup cards and button behavior
- [ ] Admin capability requirement is defined
- [ ] Setup actions are previewable or clearly described before running
- [ ] Setup actions are idempotent where possible
- [ ] Request A Quote Workflow setup maps to approved CF7/page/docs contract
- [ ] Setup/docs mention trusted `source_url` contract (no `HTTP_HOST`; WP routing only) — aligns with T-2 in 1.4.1
- [ ] No n8n webhook is exposed
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion

### 1.4.1 — Layout Blocks Validation & Quote Evaluation

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Run the deferred editor/frontend/runtime validation for the `1.1.0` card-grid and card blocks.
- Evaluate whether `skvn-marine/quote` is justified only after card-grid/card validation evidence is available.
- Keep deferred validation explicit instead of treating the untested `1.1.0` implementation as runtime-approved.
- Close **T-2** (trusted `source_url` / quote context URL) from the 2026 security audit: source hardening landed in 1.3.6; onsite verification and quote-chain confirmation belong here with the other quote evaluation work.

Carry-in from security audit — **T-2: Trusted `source_url`**

Context:

- Finding: building `source_url` from `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` allowed host-header poisoning in quote query params.
- Source fix (1.3.6): `skvn_marine_blocks_get_current_source_url()` in `modules/collection-render/cards.php` now uses WordPress routing (`get_permalink()`, `home_url()`, archive/term APIs). See `docs/standards/security-guidelines.md`.
- Remaining work for 1.4.x: prove the value end-to-end in the quote flow (URL → CF7 hidden field → CFDB7), not only in source review.

Testing:

- `docs/testing/card-grid-layout-blocks-1.1.0.md`
- `docs/testing/onsite-quote-flow-0.7.1.md` — include `source_url` host/context checks
- `docs/standards/security-guidelines.md` — T-2 audit reference

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Human runs the deferred card-grid/card editor and frontend test
- [ ] Desktop, tablet, and mobile screenshots are recorded
- [ ] No invalid-block or recovery warning appears
- [ ] Editor/frontend parity is acceptable for layout decisions
- [ ] Preset combinations do not cause overflow, overlap, or unreadable text
- [ ] Browser console issues are recorded or confirmed clean
- [ ] `skvn-marine/quote` is evaluated after validation evidence is available
- [ ] Any source defects found during validation are fixed and re-tested
- [ ] **T-2:** Product-collection (or product CTA) quote URL `source_url` matches the real onsite page URL (same site host as WordPress config; no forged/external host)
- [ ] **T-2:** CFDB7 test row stores `source_url` and it matches the page the user clicked from
- [ ] **T-2:** Human approves closing T-2 after onsite quote evidence (or documents deferral with target milestone if quote test blocked)
- [ ] Human approves closing the deferred `1.1.0` validation



### 1.3.12 — SKVN Team Credits Easter Egg

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Close the Slider milestone sequence with a private wp-admin tribute to SKVN
  employees who contributed to the project.
- Keep the tribute discoverable as an Easter egg without adding public
  frontend output or changing normal admin navigation.

Decision:

- `docs/decisions/skvn-team-credits-easter-egg-1.3.12.md`

Scope:

- Add `Built with care by the SKVN team.` to the plugin header comment.
- Trigger an accessible credits dialog/panel after five clicks on the existing
  top-level `SKVN Marine` wp-admin menu.
- Preserve normal menu navigation and count clicks across reloads with
  `sessionStorage`.

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Plugin header and admin asset contain the approved credit messages
- [ ] Normal menu clicks continue to navigate normally
- [ ] Five clicks within the governed interval open the credits experience
- [ ] Counter survives navigation in the same admin session and resets safely
- [ ] Credits UI is accessible and dismissible
- [ ] No frontend output, database write, tracking, or network request is added
- [ ] Human approves final tribute copy and any names
- [ ] PHP lint, plugin build, and wp-admin smoke test pass
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion

- [ ] Memory use settles without growth
- [ ] No invalid-block warnings on existing content
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion

### 1.5.0 — Woo Catalog Plugin (`woo-catalog`)

Status: **BRAINSTORM / PLANNING IN PROGRESS**

> ⚠️ Planning chưa hoàn tất. Cần session brainstorm riêng về data model trước khi bắt đầu.
> Milestone này phụ thuộc vào 1.3.7 (Collection UI) đã pass onsite QA.
> Step Slider foundation from 1.3.10 available for inheritance if needed.

Planning:

- `.context/planning/027_VERSION_1_5_0_WOO_CATALOG_PLUGIN_PLANNING.md`

Purpose:

- Tạo plugin riêng `woo-catalog` để sở hữu toàn bộ product data model và visual style cho B2B catalog.
- Tách data registration ra khỏi `skvn-marine-blocks` — blocks plugin sẽ optional-read từ catalog plugin.
- Enable các feature card đòi hỏi structured product data mà 1.3.7 không thể implement.
- Cung cấp catalog type selector (seafood, courses, custom) — mỗi type là 1 profile riêng.

Decisions đã chốt (2026-06-18):

- **Plugin slug**: `woo-catalog` (generic, reusable ngoài skvn-marine)
- **PHP prefix**: `woo_catalog_` (không dùng `skvn_marine_` vì plugin này là domain-agnostic)
- **Catalog type selector**: Settings page → chọn type (seafood / courses / custom-deferred) → activate profile tương ứng
- **CSS ownership split**:
  - `skvn-marine-blocks` sở hữu: card layout CSS (flexbox structure, aspect-ratio, spacing, hover shape)
  - `woo-catalog` sở hữu: semantic color CSS (cert badge colors, tag background, origin badge) — delivered as CSS custom properties
- **Style controls architecture**:
  - Global brand settings → plugin settings page → lưu vào `wp_options` → inject CSS variables vào `:root`
  - Per-block override → catalog plugin inject `InspectorControls` panel vào `skvn-marine/collection` qua WordPress `addFilter` (block plugin không biết về catalog controls)

Lý do tách plugin riêng (đã quyết định 2026-06-17):

- MOQ, Lead Time, certifications dùng nhiều hơn 1 chỗ: single product page, collection block, REST API, PDF export tương lai.
- `skvn-marine-blocks` là rendering layer — không nên sở hữu business data model.
- Deactivation independence: tắt blocks → data còn; tắt catalog → blocks gracefully degrade.
- Tránh technical debt khi single product page (1.5.x+) cũng cần hiển thị các field này.
- Plugin generic (`woo-catalog`) → có thể reuse cho site khác hoặc swap catalog type mà không sửa blocks.

Yêu cầu kỹ thuật cần note kỹ (brainstorm tiếp):

- **Certification display**: colored bullet hay icon? Badge color map per term slug? Ai owns màu — taxonomy term meta hay CSS hardcode?
- **Prefetch**: khi user hover product card, có prefetch single product page không? Cần đánh giá performance impact trước khi quyết định.
- **REST API exposure**: `show_in_rest: true` cho tất cả meta? Cần auth hay public? Ảnh hưởng đến headless future?
- **Data migration**: nếu ai đã nhập product data dạng free-text trước milestone này, migration plan như thế nào?
- **ACF dependency**: dùng ACF Free để define fields hay `register_meta` thủ công? Ảnh hưởng đến portability.
- **Spec sheet PDF**: upload attachment WordPress hay external URL? Khi attachment bị xóa thì sao?
- **MOQ unit**: "5 MT" là 1 text field hay tách `_woo_catalog_moq_value` (number) + `_woo_catalog_moq_unit` (MT/KG/container)? Ảnh hưởng đến sorting/filtering sau này.
- **Per-block attribute registration**: catalog plugin dùng hook nào để register extra attributes cho `skvn-marine/collection` mà không sửa block.json?

`skvn-marine-blocks` side (sau khi catalog plugin có):

- Optional-read pattern: `if (function_exists('woo_catalog_get_fields'))` — không fatal khi catalog inactive
- Đọc certifications, MOQ, Lead Time, spec sheet từ `woo_catalog_get_fields($product_id)` 
- Render conditionally — empty fields không render, không vỡ layout

Dependency chain:

- 1.3.7 (Collection UI) → onsite QA pass → 1.5.0 catalog data model → collection block full card style

Acceptance draft (sơ bộ, cần hoàn thiện):

- [ ] Architecture contract và data model schema được approve trước implementation
- [ ] `woo-catalog` plugin tồn tại độc lập, active/deactivate không ảnh hưởng blocks
- [ ] Catalog type selector hoạt động trong plugin settings page
- [ ] `product_certification` taxonomy registered và có WP admin UI
- [ ] MOQ, Lead Time, Spec Sheet PDF meta registered với WooCommerce product panel
- [ ] Global style settings (badge shape, colors) inject CSS variables đúng vào frontend + editor
- [ ] Catalog plugin inject per-block InspectorControls qua `addFilter` — không sửa block plugin
- [ ] `skvn-marine-blocks` optional-reads catalog fields — graceful degrade khi catalog inactive
- [ ] Collection product card hiển thị đủ certifications, MOQ, Lead Time, spec sheet link
- [ ] Human approves data model schema và field formats trước khi code
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion

### Post 1.5.x — GU Supercharger 0.0.1 Product Launch

Status: **PENDING**

Human decision (2026-06-23): Launch product plugin **sau khi V1 / 1.5.x ổn định** (woo-catalog + blocks integration + confidence trên nhiều site production). Không launch tại 1.3.11.

Decision + name research: `docs/decisions/gu-supercharger-launch-post-1.5x.md`

Identity (locked):

```text
Display name:    Gutenberg Supercharger (marketing / admin)
Plugin slug:     gu-supercharger
Text domain:     gu-supercharger
Block namespace: gu-supercharger/*
Product version: 0.0.1
```

Name research summary (2026-06-23):

- wp.org slug `gu-supercharger` — **available** (0 plugins)
- wp.org slug `supercharger` — **taken** (Supercharger AI — khác product; tránh slug trùng)
- Block namespace `gu-supercharger` — no public conflict found; migration từ `skvn-marine/*` bắt buộc

Dependencies:

- V1 / 1.5.x milestones DONE (woo-catalog + `skvn-marine-blocks` optional-read + onsite)
- 1.3.11 comprehensive QA DONE (hoặc defects từ QA đã fix trước launch)
- Multi-site migration tool + pilot evidence

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Human approves launch identity: **GU Supercharger** / **Gutenberg Supercharger** `0.0.1`
- [ ] wp.org slug `gu-supercharger` reserved or submitted (nếu distribute qua directory)
- [ ] Plugin folder/zip `gu-supercharger`; block namespace `gu-supercharger/*` registered
- [ ] Migration tool converts saved `skvn-marine/*` blocks → `gu-supercharger/*` (pilot site PASS)
- [ ] Option keys: map hoặc shim documented; không mất footer/core-control settings sau migrate
- [ ] Release metadata `0.0.1` + deploy artifact audit pass
- [ ] Runbook: deactivate `skvn-marine-blocks` → migrate → activate `gu-supercharger` (per site)
- [ ] Onsite smoke trên ≥1 pilot site: Slider + Collection + Core Control — no fatal, no invalid-block
- [ ] Human approves public launch **GU Supercharger 0.0.1**

### 1.6.0 — SKVN Surface Presets

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Add SKVN-local approved surface presets such as flat, soft, glass, elevated, and outlined.
- Keep production visual output independent from WindPress/Tailwind utilities.
- Let the theme own `skvn-surface--*` classes, tokens, fallbacks, and contrast/readability rules.
- Let plugin/editor controls select safe presets later without raw CSS, raw class, arbitrary color, blur, or shadow input.
- Design governed typography presets and a font delivery mode switch: Google CDN or local self-hosted, without raw CSS or arbitrary font URLs.

Planning:

- `.context/planning/009_VERSION_1_6_0_SKVN_SURFACE_PRESETS_PLANNING.md`

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Surface preset contract is documented before code
- [ ] Typography preset and delivery-mode contract is documented before code
- [ ] Admin can choose approved body, heading, and UI font presets without raw CSS or raw URLs
- [ ] Admin can choose Google CDN or local self-hosted delivery mode
- [ ] Frontend enqueues only the selected font delivery mode by default
- [ ] Local self-hosted mode documents cache path, failure fallback, and license/source constraints
- [ ] Theme CSS defines approved `skvn-surface--*` classes
- [ ] Presets use SKVN tokens and do not depend on WindPress
- [ ] Glass has a non-blur fallback
- [ ] Editor/frontend parity is checked for the first supported surface
- [ ] At least one SKVN-owned block or layout surface can select a preset through safe controls
- [ ] No raw class, raw CSS, or arbitrary color/blur/shadow input is required
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion

### 1.7.0 — Front page trang Chuyển đổi số

Status: **PENDING**

Purpose:

- Plan and implement the front page inspired by `.local/test-artifacts/ChuyenDoiSo.html`.
- Provide a document/resource front page with post list items that can show a thumbnail or fallback icon.
- Display tags from the external plugin-owned taxonomy without recreating or renaming that taxonomy.
- Display category lists and document/guide counts from real data, not hardcoded numbers.
- Support whole-site search styling and integration boundary; search logic remains WordPress/search-plugin owned, while SKVN owns safe visual classes and optional wrapper/block rendering.

Planning:

- `.context/planning/010_VERSION_1_7_0_FRONT_PAGE_TRANG_CHUYEN_DOI_SO_PLANNING.md`

Acceptance draft:

- [ ] Human confirms the external plugin taxonomy names and search integration boundary
- [ ] Front-page IA is documented before code: hero/search, resource list, category/count sidebar, access CTA, KPI strip, footer
- [ ] Source data ownership is documented: external plugin taxonomy/search owns data, SKVN consumes and styles
- [ ] Theme-owned visual classes are defined before plugin output depends on them
- [ ] Post/resource list supports thumbnail or fallback icon
- [ ] Tag/status badges are governed by presets/classes, not raw arbitrary classes
- [ ] Category/document counts come from real WordPress data
- [ ] Whole-site search form works with WordPress/search-plugin logic or documented hook fallback
- [ ] Core Query Loop/pattern alternative is evaluated before creating a custom block
- [ ] If a custom block is needed, it belongs in `skvn-marine-blocks` and degrades safely when the external taxonomy/search plugin is inactive
- [ ] No raw Tailwind, inline CSS, or inline scripts from the benchmark artifact are used as production content
- [ ] Human approves milestone completion
