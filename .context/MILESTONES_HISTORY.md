## V1 / 1.0.0 — V1 Launch Ready

Status: **DONE**
Started: **2026-06-05**
Completed: **2026-06-05**
Approved by human: **2026-06-05**

Purpose:

- Confirm the V1 launch-ready baseline after onsite launch.
- Close 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 onsite UI/test debt after human reported pass.
- Keep post-launch quote data-flow and map checks deferred to V1 / 1.1.2.

Recommended onsite stability plugins:

- Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) — recommended onsite admin/governance helper for menu organization and wp-admin workflow polish. SKVN source must not hardcode advanced admin menu ordering that belongs to ASE.
- Ultra Addons for Contact Form 7 — recommended onsite CF7 helper for form UI/stability enhancements around the existing CF7 workflow. This does not change the V1 rule: do not custom-code quote form handling; CF7/CFDB7 remain the quote form/data layer.
- Both plugins are external WordPress runtime dependencies only. They must not be copied or committed into this source repo.

Acceptance:

- [x] Accessibility pass
- [x] Mobile QA pass
- [x] SEO/GEO structure pass
- [x] Performance and asset loading review
- [x] Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) is reviewed/active onsite if needed for admin workflow stability.
- [x] Ultra Addons for Contact Form 7 is reviewed/active onsite if needed for CF7 form UI/stability.
- [x] No forbidden parent-theme changes
- [x] No external plugins committed to source repo
- [x] Human approves V1 launch readiness

Boundary carry-forward:

- n8n remains deferred/unexposed and should be reviewed only at the V1 → V2 boundary unless human explicitly moves it into scope earlier.

Init prompt:

- `docs/artifacts/init-prompt-v1-1.0.0-launch-ready.md`

Next milestone:

- V1 / 1.1.0 — Layout Blocks.

Started: **2026-06-05**
Moved forward by human: **2026-06-07**

Purpose:

- Add governed `skvn-marine/card-grid` and `skvn-marine/card` layout blocks.

- [x] Restored Gutenberg normal/wide/full width semantics under
      `SKVN Full Width Canvas`.
- [x] Documented the full-width surface plus governed inner-container contract.
- [x] Plugin build, PHP lint, diff check, and context consistency passed.

Carried to V1 / 1.2.9:

- Onsite Feature Showcase interaction and responsive verification.
- Real Media Library image and ALT verification.
- B2B pattern editor/frontend parity.
- Full Width Canvas normal, wide, and full alignment verification.
- Legacy saved-pattern compatibility verification.

Next milestone:

- V1 / 1.2.9 — Slider & Motion Onsite QA.

## V1 / 1.2.4 — Prepare for custom color and heading

Status: **CLOSED — SCOPE CLEANUP**
Started: **2026-06-09**
Moved forward by human: **2026-06-11**

Completed:

- [x] Fixed color drift between `theme.json` and `style.css`.
- [x] Established the customization baseline.
- [x] Reviewed `theme.json`.

Not completed in this milestone:

- Typography settings block setup was not accepted as complete.
- The human explicitly moved development forward to V1 / 1.3.0.
- Any future typography/customization work must be scheduled under an approved
  milestone instead of remaining attached to 1.2.4.

## V1 / 1.2.9 — Slider & Motion Onsite QA

Status: **CLOSED — REMAINING QA MOVED TO 1.3.1**
Started: **2026-06-09**
Moved forward by human: **2026-06-11**

Passed by human feedback:

- [x] Slider image choose, replace, remove, and editor persistence.
- [x] Slider keyboard, autoplay, reduced-motion, navigation, and responsive behavior.
- [x] Feature Showcase desktop hover/focus, mobile tap, gradients, and images.
- [x] Full Width Canvas normal, wide, and full alignment semantics.

Moved to V1 / 1.3.1:

- Slider preset sample-content insertion.
- Hero, Product Showcase, and Card Carousel frontend layouts.
- Existing-content migration and invalid-block checks after dynamic rendering.
- Accordion interaction and accessibility.
- Card motion device targeting and no-JS/reduced-motion fallbacks.
- B2B Seafood Feature Showcase pattern editor/frontend layout.
- Final invalid-block, console, layout, cache, defect, and approval checks.

Reason:

- Slider frontend QA should validate the V1 / 1.3.0 dynamic rendering contract,
  not the superseded static frontend architecture.

Next milestone:

- V1 / 1.3.0 — Slider Dynamic Rendering Architecture.

## V1 / 1.3.0 — Slider Dynamic Rendering Architecture

Status: **DONE**
Started: **2026-06-11**
Completed: **2026-06-11**
Approved by human: **2026-06-11**

Purpose:

- Move Slider and Slide frontend output to dynamic PHP rendering.
- Preserve Gutenberg InnerBlocks, block identities, existing content, and one
  Swiper runtime.
- Establish stable Hero media, overlay, content, full-width, pagination, and
  runtime lifecycle ownership.

Completed:

- [x] Slider and Slide render through plugin-owned PHP callbacks.
- [x] Existing InnerBlocks render exactly once without a bulk resave.
- [x] Attachment ID is the preferred Hero media identity with legacy URL
      fallback.
- [x] Hero media, overlay, fallback gradient, and content use explicit layers.
- [x] Product Showcase and Card Carousel retain flow layouts and suppress Hero
      background media.
- [x] Slider joins the existing SKVN full-width canvas through `alignfull`
      without viewport-width hacks.
- [x] Pagination remains inside the Slider frame.
- [x] Slider structural CSS is emitted and registered from the actual
      `style-view.ts.css` frontend asset and is also available in the editor.
- [x] One Swiper instance initializes per Slider root.
- [x] Pointer, focus, and document-visibility listeners have explicit cleanup.
- [x] Destroyed Swiper instances can return to fallback state and reinitialize.
- [x] Reduced motion disables autoplay.
- [x] Existing arbitrary delay values remain compatible.
- [x] Compatibility fixture, plugin build, PHP lint, layout audit, deploy
      artifact build, and plugin zip audit passed.
- [x] Human onsite smoke test confirmed Hero media, full-width geometry,
      controls/pagination placement, editor compatibility, and stable idle RAM.
- [x] Human approved transition to V1 / 1.3.1.

Repair evidence:

- Initial onsite failure and State Delta diagnosis:
  `docs/artifacts/start-v1-1.3.0-slider-repair.md`
- Active architecture decision:
  `docs/decisions/slider-completion-spec-1.3.0.md`

Next milestone:

- V1 / 1.3.1 — Slider Navigation & Pagination Controls UX.

## V1 / 1.3.1 — Slider Navigation & Pagination Controls UX

Status: **DONE**
Started: **2026-06-11**
Completed: **2026-06-12**
Approved by human: **2026-06-12**

Completed:

- [x] Existing dots behavior migrates to the pagination contract without invalidating content.
- [x] Arrow and pagination visibility, style, position, and clustering controls work.
- [x] Zero/one Slide disables controls and autoplay.
- [x] Timed pagination follows Swiper autoplay and real-Slide numbering.
- [x] Governed autoplay and transition durations are exposed in the editor.
- [x] Hover, focus, visibility, interaction pause, mobile, and reduced-motion behavior work.
- [x] Editor preview remains static.
- [x] Presentation panel copy, Zoom Out behavior, and governed Slider height presets were refined.
- [x] Human fully approved the milestone and requested transition.

Next milestone:

- V1 / 1.3.2 — Feature Showcase Autoplay And Panel Links.
