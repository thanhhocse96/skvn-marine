# THEME — skvn-marine

## [manual] Role

GeneratePress child theme for SKVN Marine visual system.

## [manual] Responsibilities

- Theme styles and tokens.
- GeneratePress child customization.
- Page templates and full-width layout surfaces.
- Block styles.
- Patterns.
- Woo visual overrides.
- Media ALT helper.
- Frontend animation runtime.

## [manual] Design Direction

- Use a blue-first system for V1 visual direction.
- Primary CTA remains blue, not mint or gold.
- Soft mint is the main support accent for freshness, hygiene, cold-chain, factory/process, trust strip icons, support cards, and form support surfaces.
- Bright gold is only a limited premium cue for certification, premium species badges, buyer-value highlights, or top-grade labels.
- Do not use gold as a dominant background.

Current token intent:

- Navy: `#082f49`
- Primary blue: `#0369a1`
- Support mint: `#ddfaf4`
- Premium gold: `#e9c766`

## [manual] Layout Direction

- 0.5.0 introduces a reusable page layout named `SKVN Full Width`.
- The layout is not landing-page specific. It is the general canvas for homepage, product overview, campaign, and UI test pages that need full-width Gutenberg sections.
- Keep GeneratePress header/footer intact.
- Remove or bypass the narrow default content wrapper only for pages explicitly using this template/layout.
- `alignfull` sections should reach viewport width.
- Inner content must stay constrained by SKVN design widths.
- Do not fix this by editing GeneratePress parent files.
- Do not create a custom block for this layout in V1.

## [manual] Page Display Controls

- 0.5.1 introduces page-level controls for marketing-owned pages that need alternate chrome.
- Required controls: Hide site header, Hide site footer.
- Store per-page values in post meta using `_skvn_` meta keys.
- The frontend must apply controls without editing GeneratePress parent files.
- Prefer editor/admin UI controls over raw class names.
- Do not add a header/footer builder plugin by default.

## [manual] HTML-2-Gutenberg Boundary

Theme owns the visual output contract for HTML-2-Gutenberg, not the translator tool.

Theme responsibilities:

- `skvn-*` class styling.
- Design tokens.
- Block styles.
- Patterns.
- Editor/frontend CSS parity.
- Background/decorative animation and shared animation runtime.

Plugin `skvn-marine-blocks` owns the HTML-2-Gutenberg tool itself:

- HTML artifact intake.
- Translation workflow/tooling.
- Validation.
- Future admin publisher/create-page flow.

Do not implement HTML-2-Gutenberg admin/tooling logic in the theme.

## [manual] Site Branding Governance

Brand customization is allowed, but brand variables and assets must be managed through the registry in `docs/standards/site-branding-guideline.md`.

Theme-owned brand sources:

- CSS tokens and component styles: `wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/style.css`.
- Gutenberg presets: `wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/theme.json`.
- Editor style loading: `wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/inc/setup.php`.
- Patterns: `wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/patterns/*.php`.
- Theme screenshot: `wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/screenshot.png`.

Do not move the primary brand system into the plugin. Plugin assets may follow the brand, but do not define it.

## [manual] Forbidden

- Do not edit parent GeneratePress.
- Do not register complex custom Gutenberg blocks here.
- Do not handle quote form submissions manually in V1.
