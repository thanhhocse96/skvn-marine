# PLUGIN — skvn-marine-blocks

## [manual] Role

Custom Gutenberg blocks with logic, and future plugin-owned editor/admin tooling.

## [manual] Architecture

Architecture: **Block-centric feature modules with minimal shared services**.

Each block owns feature-specific logic:

- `block.json` — block metadata and attributes
- `edit.tsx` — editor UI
- `save.tsx` — saved markup
- `view.ts` — frontend runtime only when needed
- `types.ts` — block-local TypeScript types when useful

Shared services are allowed only for cross-block invariants/utilities:

- `src/shared/motion.ts` — `prefers-reduced-motion` helpers
- `src/shared/a11y.ts` — keyboard/ARIA helpers
- `src/shared/dom.ts` — safe DOM/config parsing helpers
- `src/shared/types.ts` — truly shared TypeScript types

Do not move block-specific behavior into `shared/`.

Rule: put logic in `shared/` only when it has at least 2 consumers, or when it enforces a project invariant such as reduced motion, keyboard accessibility, or safe JSON parsing.

## [manual] Architecture Decision Rationale

Decision type: architecture/design-pattern decision.
Status: accepted.
Pattern: **Block-centric feature modules with minimal shared services**.

Why:

- Gutenberg block plugin naturally uses block as the primary unit, not MVC controller/view.
- V1 has interactive blocks (`slider`, `accordion`) that need consistent frontend runtime rules.
- Shared services prevent duplication for project invariants: reduced motion, keyboard accessibility, safe DOM/config parsing.
- Keeping feature logic inside each block avoids over-abstracting early.

Rejected patterns:

- **MVC**: rejected because Gutenberg blocks already define their own editor/save/frontend lifecycle. For this plugin, MVC would add artificial layers without clear benefit.
- **Service-heavy architecture**: rejected for V1 because the plugin is small and block-focused.
- **All logic inside each block with no shared layer**: rejected because accessibility, motion, and config parsing would be duplicated and drift between blocks.

Rules:

- Block-specific behavior stays in the block folder.
- Shared code must be cross-block utility or project invariant.
- Do not create shared abstractions for a single consumer unless it enforces a mandatory invariant.

## [manual] Folder Convention

```text
src/
  index.ts
  shared/
    a11y.ts
    dom.ts
    motion.ts
    types.ts
  slider/
    block.json
    edit.tsx
    save.tsx
    view.ts
    types.ts
  slide/
    block.json
    edit.tsx
    save.tsx
    types.ts
  accordion/
    block.json
    edit.tsx
    save.tsx
    view.ts
    types.ts
```

## [manual] Planned Blocks

- `skvn-marine/slider`
- `skvn-marine/slide`
- `skvn-marine/accordion`

## [manual] Deferred Blocks

- V1 KHÔNG build custom `skvn-marine/product-grid`.
- V1 KHÔNG build custom `skvn-marine/product-list`.
- V1 dùng WooCommerce native blocks/patterns cho product grid/list.
- V2 mới thêm Product Grid/List custom hoặc style blocks liên quan nếu cần.

## [manual] Future Admin Tooling

HTML-2-Gutenberg tooling belongs to this plugin, not the theme.

Plugin responsibilities for HTML-2-Gutenberg:

- HTML artifact intake.
- Translation workflow/tooling.
- Gutenberg markup validation.
- Brand scan/report output: `brand_source_scan`, `brand_mapping`, `brand_mismatch`, and `token_changes_needed`.
- Future admin publisher/create-page flow.
- Custom blocks only when core Gutenberg blocks plus theme patterns are insufficient.

Theme `skvn-marine` still owns the visual output contract:

- `skvn-*` classes.
- Theme CSS.
- Design tokens.
- Patterns.
- Editor/frontend CSS parity.
- Shared animation runtime.

Do not implement the HTML-2-Gutenberg admin tool in the theme.

Do not make this plugin own the primary SKVN visual system.

## [manual] Footer Settings Module And Future Gutenberg Supercharger Boundary

0.9.0 footer page settings must be implemented as a migration-ready module inside the current `skvn-marine-blocks` plugin.

Allowed current structure:

```text
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/
  modules/
    footer-settings/
```

or:

```text
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/
  includes/
    modules/
      footer-settings/
```

Current 0.9.0 rules:

- Keep plugin slug `skvn-marine-blocks`.
- Keep plugin text domain `skvn-marine-blocks`.
- Keep option key `skvn_footer_page_id`.
- Keep bootstrap and build paths compatible with the current plugin.
- Do not create a `gutenberg-supercharger` or `gutenberg-turbo` plugin in V1.
- Do not rename namespaces, option keys, plugin headers, or activation path.
- Do not add a custom CPT or display-rules system for footer settings.

Future direction:

- `Gutenberg Supercharger` is a possible V4 / 4.0.0 umbrella-plugin direction and standard/core product name.
- `Gutenberg Supercharger Stage 2` is the pro/commercial stage name.
- `Gutenberg Remap` is retained only as an alternate/redirect candidate.
- Tagline: `Remap Gutenberg. Turbocharge your site.`
- Community tagline: `Make your site feel more "Á đù VTEC".`
- Planning file: `.context/planning/008_FUTURE_CANDIDATE_GUTENBERG_TURBO_PLANNING.md`.
- When future migration is approved, modules such as `footer-settings/`, `article-templates/`, and `layout-controls/` may move under `gutenberg-supercharger/modules/`.
- Until that future milestone is explicitly approved, only use the migration-ready module shape inside the current plugin.

## [manual] SKVN Editor Controls

0.8.0 editor-control contract:

- Contract doc: `docs/decisions/skvn-editor-controls-0.8.0.md`
- Onsite test checklist: `docs/testing/onsite-editor-controls-0.8.0.md`

Plugin responsibilities:

- Sidebar UI for supported SKVN-owned blocks/surfaces.
- Block attributes.
- Saved markup.
- Interactive behavior.

Theme responsibilities remain visual:

- Tokens.
- `skvn-*` classes.
- Width, spacing, radius, shadow, and tone presets.
- Editor/frontend CSS parity.

Do not require raw class input, raw color values, arbitrary inline spacing, custom CSS, or custom JavaScript for normal marketing-editor use.

V1.x / 1.6.0 planned SKVN surface presets:

- Planning file: `.context/planning/009_VERSION_1_6_0_SKVN_SURFACE_PRESETS_PLANNING.md`.
- Plugin/editor controls may expose a safe `surfaceStyle` attribute after the theme owns the visual classes.
- Allowed values should stay preset-based: `flat`, `soft`, `glass`, `elevated`, `outlined`.
- Do not save Tailwind/WindPress utility classes as the production contract.
- Do not expose arbitrary blur, shadow, color, or raw CSS inputs for normal editors.

Slider-specific controls remain blocked until the OPEN slider editor UX tension is resolved.

0.5.1 brand-mapping contract:

- Treat artifact colors and Tailwind classes as source hints, not production contracts.
- Map visual cues to theme-owned SKVN tokens/classes when producing Gutenberg output.
- If a required token/class does not exist, report it in `token_changes_needed` or `missing_theme_classes`; do not inject raw color CSS into content.
- Leave brand profile/theme token implementation for V1 / 0.7.0.

## [manual] Rules

- Use TypeScript.
- Use `block.json`.
- Use `skvn-marine` block namespace.
- Do not depend on GeneratePress-specific markup.
