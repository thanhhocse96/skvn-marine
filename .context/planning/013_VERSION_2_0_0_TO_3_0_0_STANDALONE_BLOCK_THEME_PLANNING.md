# Version 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 Planning — Standalone SKVN Theme And Block Add-ons

Status: planning
Target: V2 / 2.0.0 migration start -> V3 / 3.0.0 completion
Scope owners: `skvn-marine` theme, `skvn-marine-blocks` plugin

## Direction

Human direction:

- `2.0.0`: start migrating away from GeneratePress.
- `3.0.0`: complete the migration and run SKVN as a standalone/custom theme.

WordPress-aligned interpretation:

- Do not move away from Gutenberg as the WordPress editor/content model.
- Move away from GeneratePress/classic-theme dependency.
- Make the SKVN theme own site structure, templates, global styles, patterns, and visual contracts.
- Keep custom blocks as optional add-ons for governed editing where core blocks are too fragile.

## Why

Current V1 works because GeneratePress supplies a stable classic-theme shell. The tradeoff is editor/frontend parity debt:

- Frontend uses GeneratePress wrappers, hooks, and layout controls.
- Gutenberg editor previews only content inside an iframe/canvas.
- Some controls live in GeneratePress panels while SKVN Page Display owns related behavior.
- Reusable header/footer/page surfaces need SKVN-owned governance before GeneratePress disappears.

The long-term target is a cleaner ownership model:

```text
SKVN theme
  -> templates
  -> global styles / theme.json
  -> patterns
  -> header/footer/page chrome
  -> visual CSS contract

SKVN blocks plugin
  -> optional custom blocks
  -> editor controls
  -> structured add-ons
  -> portability layer for future plugin/product direction
```

## Medium-Term Plan

### Phase 1 — V1.x Hardening Before Migration

Goal:

- Reduce editor/frontend parity debt without changing the theme foundation.

Actions:

- Keep GeneratePress parent untouched.
- Keep `add_editor_style( 'style.css' )` as the baseline editor style path.
- Add only small editor-only CSS where the editor canvas differs from frontend wrappers.
- Add a visual parity test fixture/checklist for reusable SKVN classes.
- Keep page display controls SKVN-owned and avoid requiring GeneratePress panel knowledge.
- Keep custom blocks deferred until repeated editor pain is proven.

Acceptance:

- [ ] Editor/frontend CSS parity checklist exists.
- [ ] Key classes are tested: `skvn-translated-hero`, `skvn-quote-context-card`, `skvn-hashtag-list`, `skvn-quote-form`, `skvn-site-footer`.
- [ ] No large duplicated editor stylesheet is created.
- [ ] No GeneratePress parent files are edited.

### Phase 2 — 2.0.0 Migration Start

Goal:

- Start replacing GeneratePress-dependent behavior with SKVN-owned adapters and contracts.

Theme actions:

- Audit all GeneratePress-specific hooks, filters, wrappers, and assumptions.
- Create SKVN-owned page display controls for layout/chrome currently split across GeneratePress panels.
- Start moving reusable header/footer assumptions into SKVN-owned render contracts.
- Treat GeneratePress adapters as temporary compatibility shims.
- Move more global values into `theme.json` where WordPress can share them across editor/frontend.

Plugin actions:

- Keep blocks additive, not required for core page rendering.
- Start with custom blocks only where core blocks + classes are repeatedly fragile.
- Candidate blocks remain governed by planning: `card-grid`, `card`, later `quote`, `hashtag-list`.
- Blocks expose preset controls, not raw classes/colors/CSS.

Acceptance:

- [ ] GeneratePress dependency audit is complete.
- [ ] SKVN Page Display can represent required page chrome/layout behavior without editor reliance on GeneratePress panels.
- [ ] Footer/header migration path is documented.
- [ ] Theme render adapters still work while GeneratePress is present.
- [ ] No feature is moved into plugin if the feature should remain theme-owned visual/site structure.

### Phase 3 — 2.x Compatibility Window

Goal:

- Run with both worlds while removing dependency pressure.

Actions:

- Keep GeneratePress compatibility only behind explicit adapter functions/classes.
- Avoid adding new GeneratePress-specific implementation unless it is a temporary migration bridge.
- Convert commonly used page surfaces into SKVN patterns/templates.
- Expand `theme.json` gradually for typography, palette, spacing, layout widths, and block style defaults.
- Evaluate whether SKVN should become:
  - a classic standalone theme with Gutenberg support, or
  - a block theme / hybrid block theme with template parts.

Decision gates:

- [ ] Human approves block theme vs classic standalone direction.
- [ ] Header/footer ownership model is confirmed.
- [ ] WooCommerce template impact is audited.
- [ ] Editor/frontend parity target is redefined for V3.

## Long-Term Plan

### Phase 4 — 3.0.0 Standalone Theme Completion

Goal:

- SKVN no longer depends on GeneratePress.

Theme actions:

- Own the complete theme shell: header, footer, template hierarchy, page chrome, content wrappers.
- Replace `generate_*` hooks and GeneratePress filters with SKVN-owned render/template APIs.
- Keep Gutenberg as the content editing model.
- Use `theme.json`, patterns, template parts, and block styles as the primary WP-aligned visual system.
- Keep classic PHP template fallback only where needed for WooCommerce or compatibility.

Plugin actions:

- Blocks remain add-ons:
  - useful when editors need governed controls,
  - not required for every layout,
  - portable enough to work beyond the SKVN theme when planned.
- Plugin blocks should not own the primary visual identity.
- Plugin blocks may expose style presets only after the theme or plugin ships the matching CSS contract.

Acceptance:

- [ ] GeneratePress is no longer required for SKVN theme activation.
- [ ] No code path depends on GeneratePress parent files, hooks, filters, or layout meta.
- [ ] Header/footer/page templates are SKVN-owned.
- [ ] Gutenberg editor remains the primary content editor.
- [ ] `theme.json` and SKVN patterns define the baseline visual system.
- [ ] Custom blocks are optional add-ons, not a replacement for the theme.

## Architecture Principles

- Theme owns site structure and visual system.
- Plugin owns optional structured editing features.
- Core Gutenberg blocks are the first choice for normal content.
- Custom blocks are justified only when editor governance, repeatability, or structured controls matter.
- `theme.json` is preferred for tokens that must exist in both editor and frontend.
- Raw class input, raw CSS, arbitrary colors, and inline styles should not be required from marketing editors.
- GeneratePress-specific behavior must not leak into V3 contracts.

## Risks

- Moving too early to a full block theme may increase WooCommerce/template work.
- Keeping too many GeneratePress adapters in 2.x can make 3.0.0 harder.
- Building too many custom blocks can recreate a page-builder dependency.
- Relying only on core blocks plus classes can remain fragile for non-technical editors.

Mitigation:

- Use 2.0.0 as migration-start, not migration-complete.
- Audit before replacing.
- Convert repeated proven patterns into governed blocks gradually.
- Keep visual parity tests and fixture pages.
- Keep the plugin additive and the theme authoritative.
