---

## Status

Status: **DECIDED**
Applies to: **V1 / 0.1.0 planning baseline**

This file does not replace `.context/MILESTONES.md`. Milestone transition remains managed there.

---

## Core Direction

V1 should stay lean and WordPress-native:

- Use GeneratePress parent theme with the `skvn-marine` child theme.
- Use Gutenberg patterns, core blocks, WooCommerce native blocks, block styles, and theme CSS for most layout sections.
- Reserve custom Gutenberg blocks for interaction-heavy features or places where editor governance becomes necessary.
- Use WooCommerce native products, categories, and attributes as the product data model.
- Avoid custom CPTs for products in V1.

---

## Theme vs Plugin Boundary

Theme `skvn-marine` owns:

- Visual system
- Design tokens
- CSS utilities
- Block styles
- Patterns
- WooCommerce visual overrides
- Section layout and presentation

Plugin `skvn-marine-blocks` owns:

- Custom blocks with real logic
- Slider / Slide block
- Accordion block
- Future product or layout blocks only if native Gutenberg/WooCommerce patterns become insufficient

External plugins remain runtime dependencies and must not be committed into the source repo.

---

## Gutenberg Layout Strategy

Default V1 strategy:

```text
Core Gutenberg blocks
+ WooCommerce native blocks
+ theme patterns
+ CSS utility classes
+ WindPress/Tailwind where useful
```

Custom block strategy:

- Do not create custom blocks for purely visual sections by default.
- Create a custom block only when logic, repeatable editor governance, or complex controls justify it.
- Prefer theme patterns first, then evaluate whether the editing experience is too fragile.

---

## HTML-2-Gutenberg Planning

Planning status: **DECIDED AS FUTURE WORK**.

User-facing feature name:

```text
HTML-2-Gutenberg
```

Sub-label:

```text
Tailwind-ready artifact importer
```

Positioning:

```text
Best for SEO
```

Reason:

- Final output remains semantic WordPress/Gutenberg content.
- Headings, paragraphs, buttons, links, and images stay editable.
- Theme CSS owns presentation through stable `skvn-*` classes.
- The site avoids screenshot-as-content, canvas text, raw prototype embeds, and inline style/script content.

### Ownership Boundary

HTML-2-Gutenberg is not a theme feature by itself.

Plugin `skvn-marine-blocks` owns:

- HTML artifact intake.
- Translation workflow/tooling.
- Validation.
- Future admin publisher/create-page flow.
- Custom blocks only when core Gutenberg blocks are insufficient.

Theme `skvn-marine` owns:

- `skvn-*` visual system.
- Theme CSS contracts.
- Design tokens.
- Block styles.
- Patterns.
- Editor/frontend style parity.
- Shared animation runtime.

Decision rule:

```text
If changing the theme would remove the tool itself, the tool belongs to the plugin.
If changing the theme would only change the visual output, the visual contract belongs to the theme.
```

Do not implement HTML-2-Gutenberg admin tooling inside the theme.

Do not make the plugin own the primary SKVN visual system.

### Scope Split

HTML-2-Gutenberg should be split into progressive milestones:

1. **Manual HTML/Tailwind Intake**
   - Human provides an HTML artifact.
   - Recommended source is an external AI-generated Tailwind HTML artifact.
   - The translator reads HTML structure and utility classes as layout intent.
   - Output is Gutenberg block markup plus SKVN contracts.

2. **Manual Gutenberg Publishing**
   - Human reviews translated output.
   - Human pastes Gutenberg markup into the editor.
   - No auto page creation in the first cut.

3. **Admin Publisher Tool**
   - Future tool accepts reviewed Gutenberg markup.
   - Form fields: page title, author, status.
   - Creates a new WordPress page.
   - Belongs to plugin/admin tooling, not theme visual CSS.

4. **AI-Assisted / Pro Intake**
   - Future/pro scope only.
   - Direct screenshot upload.
   - AI API parsing.
   - Auto-generate HTML/Tailwind intermediate artifact.
   - Review before publishing.

### V1 Decision

V1 does **not** ship runtime AI API integration.

V1 does **not** parse screenshots directly.

V1 HTML-2-Gutenberg intake accepts only human-provided HTML/Tailwind artifacts.

Recommended user workflow:

```text
Screenshot / visual idea
-> use external free AI tool to recreate or parse into Tailwind HTML
-> provide HTML artifact to SKVN HTML-2-Gutenberg workflow
-> receive Gutenberg markup + required skvn-* classes + contracts
-> paste into Gutenberg Code Editor
```

### Guardrails

- Tailwind is an input language, not the production contract.
- Do not paste Tailwind-heavy prototype markup directly into page content.
- Do not include raw `<style>` or `<script>` in page content.
- Do not turn text or CTA content into images.
- Do not add AI SDK/API dependencies in V1.
- Do not store API keys in WordPress admin for V1.
- Do not create a custom block if core Gutenberg blocks plus pattern CSS are sufficient.
- Do not auto-create pages until publisher validation is separately designed.

## Homepage Test Page Workflow

V1 layout development should use a WordPress test page before finalizing reusable patterns.

Test prompts are stored in `docs/frontpage-testing.md`.

Method:

```text
Create a WP test page
→ assemble the full homepage using core blocks, WooCommerce native blocks, OpenStreetMap iframe embed, placeholder/network images, and English placeholder copy
→ apply SKVN wrapper classes and Tailwind/WindPress utility classes
→ code/refine child theme CSS and theme patterns
→ refresh desktop/mobile views
→ compare against the reference layout and acceptance checklist
→ extract stable sections into reusable theme patterns
```

Test page should cover:

- Top utility bar and main header.
- Hero panel with image/media composition.
- Category strip.
- Combo/product card section.
- Why-choose/trust strips.
- Featured product section using WooCommerce-native direction or placeholders.
- Promo/cold-chain banner.
- Process steps.
- Map/contact section.
- Newsletter signup band with replaceable image block.
- Footer.

Rules:

- Use English placeholder copy; exact translation is not required.
- Images may be placeholders or remote images, but final CSS must not hardcode image URLs.
- Tailwind/WindPress class choices should be explicit enough to verify layout behavior.
- Do not create custom blocks until the pattern approach proves insufficient.
- Do not add new builder plugins for this workflow.
- Mobile checks are mandatory before marking a section stable.

---

## Header / Footer

V1 decision:

- Use GeneratePress header/footer baseline plus SKVN child theme CSS.
- Do not add a header/footer builder plugin by default.
- If a template reference looks good, translate its structure into theme CSS, WordPress menus, and theme pattern/template code.

Header should include:

- Logo/site identity.
- Native WordPress menu.
- Primary CTA such as Request a Quote when needed.
- Responsive mobile navigation using GeneratePress baseline behavior unless a clear gap appears.

Footer should include:

- Company information.
- Product/category links.
- Contact information.
- Optional trust feature strip above footer.
- Optional newsletter signup band above footer.
- Optional certification/social area if content is available.

Future plugin/builder condition:

- Reconsider a builder plugin only if non-technical editors must frequently redesign global header/footer layouts without developer support.

---

## Trust Strip / Newsletter Band

V1 decision:

- Implement as reusable theme patterns with SKVN child theme CSS.
- Do not create a custom block by default.
- Do not add a new newsletter plugin by default.
- If newsletter submission must work in V1, use CF7 markup/shortcode and keep form classes aligned with the project form system.
- Do not custom-code a newsletter form handler in the theme.

Trust feature strip should include:

- Icon/image.
- Short headline.
- Supporting text.
- Four-column desktop layout.
- Responsive two-column/tablet and single-column/mobile layout.

Newsletter signup band should include:

- Title.
- Short description.
- Email field and submit button or CF7 form placeholder.
- Replaceable Image block for product/carton artwork.
- Image overhang outside the band on desktop.

Theme CSS should handle:

- Stable wrapper classes such as `skvn-trust-strip`, `skvn-newsletter-band`, `skvn-newsletter-media`, and `skvn-newsletter-media--overhang`.
- Image positioning and responsive fallback.
- Preventing overhanging image from covering text or form controls.
- Mobile stack where image no longer overhangs if space is limited.

Editor behavior:

- Image source must stay editable via the core Image block.
- User should be able to replace the artwork with Upload/Media Library without touching code.
- CSS must not hardcode the image URL.

Future custom block condition:

- Consider a custom block only if editors need locked controls for image position, overhang amount, mobile visibility, layout variant, or form source.

---

## Hero / Front Panel

The hero direction is a large visual front panel with possible layered composition:

- Background image or scene
- Text content
- Optional foreground seafood/company imagery
- Floating feature strip overlapping the bottom edge

V1 decision:

- Implement as a theme pattern with CSS utilities.
- Do not create a custom hero block yet.
- Use stable classes such as:
  - `skvn-hero-panel`
  - `skvn-overlap-wrap`
  - `skvn-overlap-strip`

Future custom block condition:

- Consider `skvn-marine/hero-panel` only if marketing/editor users need safe sidebar controls for background image, foreground image, overlap, responsive spacing, or layout variants.

---

## Feature Strip / Category Strip

There are two separate concepts:

1. Company feature strip
   - Icon
   - Heading or metric
   - Short text
   - Example: quality, export, cold chain, factory capability

2. Product category strip
   - Category image or icon
   - Product category name
   - Based on WooCommerce categories when it represents real product taxonomy

V1 decision:

- Company feature strip: theme pattern + CSS.
- Product category strip: WooCommerce native category/product blocks where possible.
- Do not create a custom block for these in V1 unless editor governance becomes necessary.

---

## Stat / Icon Card

The stat/icon card pattern covers cards like:

```text
Icon
Heading or metric: 8,000+
Label: TAN / NHAN SU
Description: Kho lanh bao quan / Lanh nghe va tan tam
```

Required layout variants:

- Horizontal: icon beside text stack
- Vertical: icon above text stack

V1 decision:

- Implement with Gutenberg Group/Image/Heading/Paragraph inside theme patterns.
- Use CSS classes or block styles for layout variants:
  - `skvn-stat-card`
  - `skvn-stat-card--horizontal`
  - `skvn-stat-card--vertical`

Do not create a custom `skvn-marine/stat-card` block in V1 by default.

Future custom block condition:

- Create `skvn-marine/stat-card` only if editors need locked controls for icon, heading, label, description, card style, and horizontal/vertical icon placement.
- The custom block may support:
  - Icon source or icon picker
  - Heading / metric
  - Label
  - Description
  - Layout: horizontal or vertical
  - Icon position: left, top, or right
  - Card style: plain, bordered, filled, compact

---

## Product Data Model

Products should be modeled as WooCommerce data, not static text.

Use WooCommerce Product for commercial product items, for example:

```text
Grouper Fish Fillet Skin-On
```

Use Product Category for product families, for example:

```text
Grouper Fish
Shrimp
Squid
Crab
Clam
```

Use WooCommerce attributes for specs that may need filtering, searching, comparing, or structured display:

- Scientific Name
- Pack Type
- Size
- Breaded/Battered
- Bones In/Out
- Shell On/Off
- Skin On/Off
- Tail On/Off
- Cooking Methods
- Seasonality
- Farmed/Wild
- Method of Catch

ACF or Meta Box can be considered later only when WooCommerce attributes are not enough for editorial fields or display ordering.

---

## Homepage Product List UX

The homepage product section should feel like a B2B seafood/export catalog, not a retail shop grid.

Product cards should prioritize:

- Product image
- Product or category name
- Processing type badge, such as fillet, whole, block, HOSO
- Key specs
- Available sizes
- CTA: View specifications / Request a quote
- Future chatbot hook

Do not prioritize price on the homepage unless the business explicitly wants retail-style commerce.

Mobile rule:

- Main CTA must always be visible.
- Do not make important actions hover-only.

Future chatbot hook can be prepared with data attributes:

```html
data-skvn-product-id
data-skvn-product-sku
data-skvn-product-name
data-skvn-product-url
data-skvn-chat-context="product-card"
```

---

## Product Grid / List

V1 decision:

- Use WooCommerce native blocks/patterns.
- Do not build custom Product Grid/List blocks in V1.
- Custom Product Grid/List or related style blocks are deferred to V2 or later.

Reason:

- Native WooCommerce blocks provide a faster baseline.
- Product data model and homepage information architecture should stabilize before creating custom query/display blocks.

---

## Map / Contact Section

Selected direction:

- Use OpenStreetMap iframe embed for V1.
- SKVN theme provides the pattern and visual wrapper.
- Reason: target shared host supports PHP 8.0 only; `Out of the Block: OpenStreetMap` requires PHP 8.1.

V1 implementation should be:

```text
Core HTML block or pattern markup containing an OpenStreetMap iframe
+ SKVN contact/location pattern
+ SKVN CSS wrapper
```

Pattern should include:

- OSM iframe embed, not a map plugin block
- Contact card overlaid on the map on desktop, aligned to the right side.
- Card company name heading.
- Address
- Phone/email
- CTA button

Theme CSS should handle:

- Map height
- Border radius
- Contact card overlay positioning on desktop.
- Contact card white background, subtle shadow, compact spacing, and 8px or smaller radius unless the design system later changes it.
- Pin/marker emphasis near the left side of the map composition.
- Responsive stack
- Popup typography
- Spacing
- Visual framing

Target visual direction:

```text
Full-width map panel
+ large blue map pin emphasis on the left
+ floating white company contact card on the right
+ dark blue bottom band or surrounding section frame where needed
```

Mobile behavior:

- Keep map readable.
- Move contact card below or above the map if overlay would reduce legibility.
- Phone/email remain visible without hover.

Do not create a custom map block in V1.
Do not add a new map plugin in V1 unless iframe embed proves insufficient.

Future condition:

- If the site needs stronger brand control, fewer map POIs, custom tile styling, multiple markers, or richer editor controls, evaluate Mapbox/custom tile provider or a PHP-compatible map plugin later.

---

## About / Factory Capability Section

V1 decision:

- Implement factory/about/capability sections as theme patterns and CSS.
- Do not create a custom block unless the section becomes data-driven or requires complex editor controls.

Possible section parts:

- Intro text
- Factory image
- Image stack
- Stats cards
- Certification strip
- Capability highlights

---

## Slider / Swiper

Slider remains a custom block feature.

Requirements:

- Slider/Slide lives in `skvn-marine-blocks`.
- Swiper is used only for slider frontend runtime.
- Swiper should load only when a slider block exists on the frontend.
- Editor uses stacked or simplified preview.
- Do not run autoplay carousel in editor.
- Keyboard navigation is required.
- Pause on hover is required.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

## Accessibility

Accessibility is required for interactive blocks and important CTAs.

V1 should account for:

- Keyboard navigation for slider and accordion
- Visible focus states
- ARIA states where useful
- Reduced motion support
- Mobile-visible CTAs
- No hover-only primary actions

---

## Plugin / Dependency Direction

External plugins discussed for V1 runtime:

- WooCommerce
- Contact Form 7
- CFDB7
- Rank Math
- Antispam Bee
- WindPress

Polylang:

- Prepare text domains and avoid hardcoded UI strings.
- Do not activate unless multilingual becomes a confirmed V1 requirement.

ACF / Meta Box:

- Do not install immediately.
- Re-evaluate if WooCommerce attributes are insufficient.

---

## V1 Scope

Do in V1:

- Child theme baseline
- Design system / tokens / typography
- Block styles
- Header/footer baseline using GeneratePress + SKVN child theme CSS
- Trust strip and newsletter signup reusable patterns
- Hero pattern
- Feature strip pattern
- Stat/icon card pattern
- About/factory pattern
- WooCommerce product/category sections using native blocks
- Map/contact pattern using OpenStreetMap iframe embed
- Slider block
- Accordion block
- Page display/sidebar controls in 0.5.1; Quote UI/editor controls in 0.6.0; CF7/CFDB7 after 0.6.0; n8n automation after 1.0.0
- Product data entry using WooCommerce

Do not do in V1 by default:

- Custom Product Grid/List block
- Custom Hero block
- Custom Map block
- Custom Stat/Icon Card block
- Custom CPT for products
- Advanced product filter
- Quote cart
- Multi-product quote table
- Popup quote flow as primary UX
- Complex technical product card/spec table block

---

## Summary Decision

V1 uses Gutenberg patterns and theme CSS for most visual sections. Custom blocks are reserved for interaction-heavy logic or editor governance that cannot be safely handled with native blocks and patterns.

Product data uses WooCommerce native products, categories, attributes, and native WooCommerce blocks/patterns in V1.

Map uses OpenStreetMap iframe embed in V1, wrapped by SKVN patterns and CSS. A map plugin is deferred because the target shared host only supports PHP 8.0.

Hero, feature strip, stat/icon cards, about/factory, and map/contact are implemented as theme patterns first. Custom wrapper blocks may be considered later only if editor controls become necessary.
