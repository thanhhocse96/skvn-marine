# Versioning And Release Workflow

## Purpose

Keep milestone planning versions and WordPress release artifact versions from drifting.

`.context/MILESTONES.md` controls scope and planning. It does not automatically update WordPress theme/plugin headers.

Before packaging or deploying a milestone release, sync release metadata with the target milestone version.

## Version Sources

Update these together for a release:

```text
wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/style.css
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/skvn-marine-blocks.php
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/package.json
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/package-lock.json
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/src/*/block.json
wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks/build/*/block.json
```

Theme and plugin asset cache-busting still uses `filemtime()` where available. The `Version:` headers are for WordPress release identity, update screens, zip metadata, and human audit.

## Bump Command

From the repo root:

```bash
node tools/bump-project-version.mjs 0.9.0
```

Use the milestone or release version approved by the human.

After bumping:

```bash
wsl -d Debian -- bash -lc "source /home/shinkuro/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 20 && cd /mnt/d/Github/skvn-marine/wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks && npm run build"
```

Then inspect:

```bash
git diff -- wp-content/themes/skvn-marine/style.css wp-content/plugins/skvn-marine-blocks
```

## When To Bump

Bump when:

- packaging a theme/plugin zip for a milestone release
- human approves moving from one milestone to the next
- deploy artifact should advertise a new version in WordPress admin

Do not bump for every small local edit.

## Release Checklist

```text
[ ] Human approved target milestone/release version.
[ ] Run node tools/bump-project-version.mjs <version>.
[ ] Run plugin build after bump.
[ ] Run PHP syntax checks for touched PHP files.
[ ] Run git diff --check.
[ ] Build deploy artifact.
[ ] Package theme/plugin zip if needed.
[ ] Confirm WordPress admin shows the expected theme/plugin version after upload.
```

## Guardrails

- Do not treat build asset hashes as project versions.
- Do not rely on `npm run build` to update WordPress `Version:` headers.
- Do not change plugin/theme slug, text domain, namespace, or option keys while bumping version.
- Do not bump future planning candidates such as `Gutenberg Supercharger` into the current SKVN Marine plugin identity.
