# Slider Completion Spec — V1 / 1.3.0

Status: APPROVED
Approved: 2026-06-11
Milestone: V1 / 1.3.0 — Slider Dynamic Rendering Architecture
Source of truth: this document

## 1. Goal

Complete the current `skvn-marine/slider` and `skvn-marine/slide` foundation
before adding broader carousel/showcase features.

V1 / 1.3.0 owns:

- Dynamic PHP rendering for Slider and Slide frontend markup.
- Compatibility with existing saved Slider content.
- Stable media, overlay, and content layers.
- The existing Hero, Product Showcase, and Card Carousel presets.
- Baseline responsive geometry, accessibility, reduced motion, and no-JavaScript
  readability.

V1 / 1.3.0 does not own:

- The carousel/showcase 5x2 editor grid.
- Marquee or Centered Carousel modes.
- Card-level LinkControl, visual presets, or responsive spacing controls.
- Fullscreen Step Slider.
- Zoom, blob, parallax, stagger, arbitrary speed, or another movement runtime.

## 2. Approved Scope Decisions

1. V1 / 1.3.0 fixes the rendering foundation. The expanded carousel/showcase UX
   is a later milestone with a version assigned only after human approval.
2. Hero supports a maximum of five Slides, one Slide per view, and `fade` or
   `slide`. Zoom, blobs, and parallax are deferred.
3. Product Showcase supports a maximum of five Slides, one Slide per view, and
   one content Image block per Slide. It does not expose or render the Hero
   background-image treatment.
4. Card Carousel retains the current 3/2/1 desktop/tablet/mobile behavior. The
   ten-card limit belongs to the later editor-grid milestone.
5. V1 / 1.3.0 keeps the current editor controls and adds validation,
   accessibility, and runtime hardening. It does not add marquee, centered
   mode, or new progress variants.
6. Existing content must open and render without invalid-block recovery or a
   bulk resave.
7. Fullscreen Step Slider remains a separate V1 / 1.5.0 block family.

## 3. Stable Block Boundary

```text
skvn-marine/slider
└── skvn-marine/slide
```

- Keep both block names and the `skvn-marine` namespace.
- Keep Gutenberg InnerBlocks and native List View.
- Keep one Swiper runtime.
- Do not replace child blocks with a `slides` array or proprietary slide
  manager.
- Keep block behavior portable without requiring the SKVN theme.

## 4. Render Ownership

PHP owns current frontend HTML:

```html
<div class="wp-block-skvn-marine-slider skvn-slider swiper"
     data-skvn-slider="...">
  <div class="skvn-slider__wrapper swiper-wrapper">
    <!-- rendered Slide children -->
  </div>
  <!-- optional arrows and pagination -->
</div>
```

```html
<div class="wp-block-skvn-marine-slide skvn-slide swiper-slide">
  <div class="skvn-slide__media">
    <!-- optional Hero image and overlay -->
  </div>
  <div class="skvn-slide__content">
    <!-- rendered InnerBlocks -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Ownership:

| Layer | Owner |
|---|---|
| Slider shell, config, arrows, pagination | Slider PHP renderer |
| Slide frame, Hero media, overlay, content wrapper | Slide PHP renderer |
| Editable content and block order | Gutenberg InnerBlocks |
| Swipe, fade, loop, autoplay, keyboard, breakpoints | Swiper runtime |
| Structural fallback styling | Plugin CSS |

All PHP output must use WordPress escaping. Attribute values must be normalized
to approved booleans, number ranges, and enum values before rendering.

## 5. Preset Contracts

### Hero

- Maximum five Slides.
- One Slide per view.
- `fade` or `slide`.
- Background image belongs to the Slide media layer.
- Overlay and content render above the image.
- Images with different intrinsic dimensions fill one stable frame.

### Product Showcase

- Maximum five Slides.
- One Slide per view.
- Flow-based Image block and content layout.
- Saved legacy background-image attributes may remain stored for compatibility
  but are not rendered.

### Card Carousel

- Responsive Slides per view: 3 desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile.
- Flow-based card content.
- Saved legacy background-image attributes may remain stored but are not
  rendered.
- Equal-height and CTA alignment are CSS/runtime QA requirements, not new
  arbitrary editor controls.

## 6. Editor Contract

- Do not run Swiper or autoplay in Gutenberg.
- Hero remains vertically readable.
- Product Showcase and Card Carousel remain directly editable with native
  InnerBlocks for this milestone.
- Native List View/actions remain the structural management interface.
- Enforce the approved five-Slide maximum for Hero and Product Showcase without
  invalidating existing content that already exceeds it.
- Do not expose duplicate background-image controls for Product Showcase or
  Card Carousel.

The later carousel/showcase milestone may replace the carousel editor surface
with the approved non-moving 5x2 grid and ten-card limit.

## 7. Compatibility Plan

Before changing registration or save behavior:

1. Inventory the saved Slider/Slide shapes from initial blocks, image-enabled
   Slides, and preset-enabled Sliders.
2. Create compatibility fixtures for each shape.
3. Decide the minimum `save()` and `deprecated` definitions required for
   Gutenberg validation.
4. Register PHP render callbacks without changing block names or attributes.
5. Prove old content opens, renders, edits, saves, and reloads without recovery.

Transitional static definitions exist only for editor parsing compatibility.
There must be one active frontend render engine: PHP.

## 8. Runtime And Accessibility

- Add Swiper A11y support and meaningful labels for navigation controls.
- Keep keyboard navigation enabled.
- Pause autoplay on pointer hover and keyboard focus within the Slider.
- Disable autoplay under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Guard malformed JSON/config values.
- Prevent duplicate initialization.
- Leave all Slide content readable when JavaScript is unavailable.
- Do not hide editor or frontend content by default while waiting for runtime.

## 9. CSS Geometry

- Slider viewport, Slide width, Slide internal layout, arrow hit areas, and
  pagination each have one owner.
- Hero media uses `object-fit: cover` inside a stable frame.
- Arrows and pagination must not overlap content or the page footer.
- Card Carousel must not create horizontal page overflow.
- Replace the current Hero `100vw` content-padding calculation unless a
  documented geometry test proves that viewport ownership is intentional.
- Do not use `overflow-x: hidden` or `clip` to conceal incorrect geometry.
- Test desktop with a visible vertical scrollbar, tablet, and mobile.

## 10. Delivery Plan

### Phase A — Contract And Fixtures

- Freeze the attribute/schema matrix.
- Capture legacy saved-markup fixtures.
- Define registration and compatibility behavior.

### Phase B — Dynamic Renderer

- Add the plugin-owned Slider render module.
- Register Slider and Slide render callbacks.
- Implement escaping and preset-specific media behavior.

### Phase C — Runtime And CSS

- Harden Swiper initialization and accessibility.
- Implement stable Hero layers and responsive preset geometry.
- Remove or prove unsafe viewport-width calculations.

### Phase D — Verification And Packaging

- Build plugin assets.
- Run PHP syntax checks.
- Verify compatibility fixtures.
- Build the deploy artifact and plugin zip.
- Confirm the Slider render module exists in the zip.
- Complete onsite QA under V1 / 1.3.1.

## 11. Acceptance

- Existing Slider content opens without invalid-block recovery.
- Existing Slider content renders through PHP without requiring bulk resave.
- Hero media, overlay, and content remain in one stable frame.
- Product Showcase and Card Carousel do not render accidental Hero backgrounds.
- Card Carousel remains 3/2/1 responsive.
- Arrows, dots, keyboard, loop, autoplay, hover/focus pause, and reduced motion
  work as approved.
- No-JavaScript output remains readable.
- No horizontal page overflow is introduced.
- PHP escaping and attribute validation pass review.
- Runtime PHP files are present in deploy artifacts and plugin zip.
- Plugin build, PHP lint, compatibility checks, and onsite QA pass.
- Human explicitly approves milestone completion.
