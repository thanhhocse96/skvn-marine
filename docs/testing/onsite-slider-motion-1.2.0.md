# Onsite Slider Editor & Motion 1.2.0 Test

Status: **READY FOR HUMAN TEST**
Target milestone: **V1 / 1.2.0 — Slider Editor & Motion**

## Target

- Onsite WordPress editor and frontend.
- A draft test page containing at least two SKVN Accordion blocks and one SKVN Card Grid with four SKVN Card blocks.

## Preconditions

- Deploy the `skvn-marine-blocks` plugin development build version `1.2.0`.
- Clear page/cache layers that can retain old plugin JavaScript or CSS.
- Keep the browser console open during frontend checks.
- Use a draft or private test page instead of changing production content directly.

## Setup

1. Create a draft page using the normal onsite SKVN editing workflow.
2. Add one `SKVN Slider` and keep its two default `SKVN Slide` children.
3. Add two `SKVN Accordion` blocks with different content lengths.
4. Add one `SKVN Card Grid` containing four `SKVN Card` blocks.
5. Configure the cards:
   - Card 1: `Fade up`, `On scroll`, Desktop and Tablet enabled, Mobile disabled.
   - Card 2: `Fade in`, `Always`, all devices enabled.
   - Card 3: `Hover lift`, Desktop enabled, Tablet and Mobile disabled.
   - Card 4: `None`.
6. Save the draft and open its frontend preview.

## Slider Editor Checks

1. Confirm each stacked Slide shows `Choose background image` instead of only bare heading/copy fields.
2. Choose an image from the WordPress Media Library for Slide 1.
3. Confirm the selected image appears as the Slide background in the editor.
4. Edit the heading, lead paragraph, and CTA button directly over the image.
5. Change Overlay opacity between 0% and 80% and confirm the preview updates.
6. Use `Replace image`, select a different image, and confirm the preview updates.
7. Use `Remove image` and confirm the media chooser returns without deleting text/CTA content.
8. Set different images on both slides, save, and reload the editor.
9. Confirm images and overlay settings persist without invalid-block or recovery warnings.

## Slider Frontend Checks

1. Confirm the Slider shows one slide at a time rather than a vertical list.
2. Confirm each background image covers its slide without stretching.
3. Confirm heading, lead, and CTA remain readable above the overlay.
4. Confirm arrows, dots, keyboard navigation, loop, autoplay, and pause-on-hover follow Slider settings.
5. Confirm Swiper layout/navigation CSS loads without relying on the SKVN theme.
6. Enable Reduce motion and confirm autoplay is disabled.

## Editor Checks

1. Confirm Accordion content remains visible and editable in the editor.
2. Confirm Card content remains visible when any motion preset is selected.
3. Confirm the Motion panel offers only `None`, `Fade up`, `Fade in`, and `Hover lift`.
4. Confirm Fade up/Fade in offer only `On scroll` and `Always`.
5. Confirm Hover lift does not show an irrelevant trigger selector.
6. Confirm Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile are independent toggles.
7. Save and reload the editor.
8. Confirm no invalid-block or block-recovery warning appears.

## Accordion Frontend Checks

1. Confirm both Accordion panels load collapsed after JavaScript enhancement.
2. Open each panel and confirm its real content height is shown without clipping.
3. Close each panel and confirm height animates smoothly to zero.
4. Rapidly open and close one panel; confirm it does not remain stuck or clipped.
5. Use `Tab`, then `Enter` and `Space`, to focus and toggle a heading.
6. Use `Arrow Down` / `Arrow Up` to move between headings.
7. Use `Home` / `End` to move to the first/last heading.
8. Confirm focus is visible.
9. Confirm the accessibility tree reports a button with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.

## Card Motion Frontend Checks

1. At desktop width, scroll Card 1 into view. It should reveal once with Fade up; resizing must not replay it.
2. Reload and confirm Card 2 runs Fade in on page load.
3. On a mouse/trackpad desktop device, hover Card 3 and confirm it lifts slightly.
4. Confirm Card 4 remains static.
5. At tablet width, Card 1 remains enabled and Card 3 remains static.
6. At mobile width, Card 1 and Card 3 remain static; Card 2 remains enabled.
7. On a touch-only device, confirm Hover lift does not activate.

## Fallback And Accessibility Checks

1. Enable operating-system/browser `Reduce motion`, reload, and confirm:
   - Accordion opens and closes without animated transition.
   - Card content is immediately visible.
   - No card entrance or hover animation runs.
2. Disable JavaScript for one reload and confirm:
   - Accordion content remains visible instead of being trapped collapsed.
   - All Card content remains visible.
3. Re-enable JavaScript after this check.

## Pass Criteria

- No invalid-block warning appears.
- Slider images can be chosen, replaced, removed, saved, and rendered.
- Slider editor remains stacked and editable; frontend initializes as Swiper.
- Accordion interaction, ARIA state, focus, and keyboard navigation work.
- Accordion content is never clipped after open/close or rapid toggling.
- Card controls save and reload correctly.
- Device targeting matches all three independent toggles.
- Motion runs only for the matching preset, trigger, and device combination.
- Reduced-motion and no-JavaScript fallbacks leave all content visible.
- No frontend console error references `skvn-marine-blocks`, motion runtime, or Accordion.

## Fail Evidence To Report

- Target page URL.
- Browser/device and viewport width.
- Screenshot or short screen recording.
- Exact block preset, trigger, and device-toggle combination.
- Whether Reduce motion or JavaScript-disable mode was active.
- Console error text and stack trace, if present.
- Whether the issue occurs in editor, frontend, or both.
