# Onsite Completion Checklist — 0.11.0 + 0.12.0

Purpose:

- Confirm the deployed `0.11.0` admin/footer appearance work and `0.12.0` header/search work on the onsite WordPress site.
- Use this checklist before asking an agent to move the project to `V1 / 1.0.0 — V1 Launch Ready`.
- Local UI runtime is intentionally out of scope for this pass because local UI loading is slow; use source checks plus onsite evidence.

Target surfaces:

- WP Admin: `SKVN Marine -> Footer`
- WP Admin: `SKVN Marine -> Header`
- Frontend: homepage, at least one short page, product/category surfaces, search results page.

Deploy preconditions:

- Deploy current `build/skvn-marine.zip` and `build/skvn-marine-blocks.zip` or equivalent built theme/plugin folders.
- Confirm `skvn-marine` child theme is active.
- Confirm `skvn-marine-blocks` plugin is active.
- Confirm GeneratePress parent theme is installed and active as the parent.
- Confirm WooCommerce is active before testing product search.
- Do not activate Polylang for this pass.
- Do not expose or configure n8n.
