### Open Layout Issue — Full-Width Container Not Escaping

Status:

```text
OPEN
```

Observed in local runtime:

```text
An `alignfull` group inside the pattern test page still appears constrained by the page/content container.
The visual result looks like a large page wrapper with the content box trapped inside instead of the hero band reaching full viewport width.
Screenshot evidence is now available from 2026-05-21 local runtime.
The light-blue hero background reaches the viewport, but the hero grid/content is still visually trapped in a narrow centered column.
The headline wraps too aggressively because the text column is too narrow for the intended desktop hero layout.
The media column renders, but the composition does not match the intended wide ecommerce landing-page hero.
```

Reference note:

```text
See user-provided diagram: page wrapper, header/menu inside, and content area still boxed instead of full-width.
See user-provided screenshot: C:/Users/VPF-Champion/Downloads/Screenshot 2026-05-21 at 14-31-52 Minh Hai Fish Local.png

```

Likely investigation targets:

```text
[ ] GeneratePress page layout setting: full-width/no-sidebar/content container.
[ ] Whether page title/content wrapper is still constrained.
[ ] Whether `.entry-content` or `.site-content` limits `alignfull`.
[ ] Whether `.alignfull` needs child-theme CSS escape rule.
[ ] Whether pattern wrapper `.skvn-pattern-test-page` is preventing full-width behavior.
```

Do not close until:

```text
[x] Runtime screenshot captured.
[ ] Desktop full-width hero band reaches viewport width.
[ ] Inner hero content remains constrained to SKVN wide width.
[ ] Mobile has no horizontal scroll.
[ ] Desktop headline keeps intended line breaks and does not collapse into a narrow text column.
[ ] Desktop image column aligns with the hero content and supports the intended wide composition.
```

## 0.5.0 SKVN Full Width Layout

Objective:

```text
Create a reusable theme-owned page layout for pages that need full-width Gutenberg sections without losing GeneratePress header/footer.
```

Scope:

```text
In scope:
- SKVN Full Width page template/layout.
- Full-width content surface for selected pages.
- alignfull escape behavior.
- Inner SKVN max-width constraints.
- Pattern UI test page validation.

Out of scope:
- Quote flow integration.
- Custom product grid/list blocks.
- Custom hero block.
- Editing GeneratePress parent theme.
```

Acceptance:

```text
[x] Page can select/use SKVN Full Width at source/template level.
[x] Header/footer calls remain in the template.
[x] Default narrow page content wrapper is bypassed by the template source.
[x] alignfull section backgrounds can reach viewport width at CSS contract level.
[x] Inner content remains aligned to SKVN wide container at CSS contract level.
[ ] Desktop hero headline no longer collapses into an unintended narrow column.
[ ] Image/media column aligns with the intended wide composition.
[ ] Mobile has no horizontal scroll.
[x] PHP syntax check passes.
[ ] Runtime screenshot reviewed.
```

Test method:

```text
1. Apply SKVN Full Width to Pattern UI Test 0.2.0 or a new layout test page.
2. Insert the existing homepage/pattern hero test content.
3. Preview desktop at wide viewport.
4. Confirm hero background reaches viewport width.
5. Confirm hero inner grid uses SKVN wide width, not the old narrow content column.
6. Preview mobile.
7. Confirm no horizontal scroll and no overlap.
8. Record PASS / FAIL / NEEDS REVISION.
```

In scope for upcoming V1 work:

```

Deferred proposals:

```text

## 0.3.0 Technical Debt

Debt status:

```text
OPEN
```

Source/build checks for the Slider/Slide block have passed. Runtime validation and human approval are intentionally still pending.

### Debt 1 — Slider Runtime Smoke Test

Purpose:

```text
Prove the built slider works inside the real local WordPress runtime, not only by source-level tests.
```

How to test:

```text
1. Confirm local WP runtime responds at http://localhost:8080/wp-login.php.
2. Confirm runtime uses the custom plugin from source or current deployed copy.
3. Activate SKVN Marine Blocks if needed.
4. Create a test page named: Slider Runtime Test 0.3.0.
5. Insert SKVN Slider block.
6. Add at least 3 SKVN Slide child blocks.
7. Set autoplay on, delay 5000, loop on, arrows on, dots on, effect slide.
8. Publish or preview page.
9. Confirm slider initializes on frontend.
10. Confirm arrows work.
11. Confirm dots work.
12. Confirm keyboard navigation works.
13. Confirm autoplay pauses on hover.
14. Confirm no serious browser console errors.
15. Test with reduced motion enabled; autoplay must not run.
```

Pass evidence:

```text
[ ] Frontend URL recorded.
[ ] Desktop screenshot reviewed.
[ ] Mobile screenshot reviewed.
[ ] Console checked.
[ ] Result recorded as PASS / FAIL / NEEDS REVISION.
```

### Debt 2 — Human Milestone Approval

Purpose:

```text
Human confirms 0.3.0 is acceptable after runtime smoke test evidence exists.
```

How to close:

```text
1. Runtime smoke test must be PASS.
2. Human reviews the slider test page.
3. Human explicitly approves 0.3.0 completion.
4. Only then tick "Human approves milestone completion" in .context/MILESTONES.md.
5. Do not auto-transition to 0.4.0 unless human explicitly approves the milestone move.
```
